class ProfileSynapse(bt.Synapse):
    """
    The ProfileSynapse subclass of the Synapse class encapsulates the functionalities related to HIP Task Scenerios.

    It specifies seven fields - `id`, `label`, `type`, `options`, `value`, `image`, `answer` - that define the state of the ProfileSynapse object.
    All of the fields except `answer` are read-only fields defined during object initialization, and `answer` is a mutable
    field that can be updated as the scenario progresses.

    The Config inner class specifies that assignment validation should occur on this class (validate_assignment = True),
    meaning value assignments to the instance fields are checked against their defined types for correctness.

    Attributes:
        id (str): A unique identifier for the task. This field is both mandatory and immutable.
        type (str): A string that specifies the type of the task. This field is both mandatory and immutable and can take values "Generated" and "User" only.
        public_repos (int): A int that captures the public repos of the user.
        created_at (datetime): A datetime that captures the date of account creation.
        total_commits (int): A int that captures the total commits of the user.
        eth_balance (float): A int that captures the eth balance of the user.
        tao_balance (float): A int that captures the tao balance of the user.
        tao_staked (int): A int that captures the tao staked of the user.
        no_of_transactions (int): A int that captures the no of transactions of the user.
        score (float): A string that captures the score to the profile. This field is mutable.


    Methods:
        deserialize() -> "ProfileSynapse": Returns the instance of the current object.


    The `ProfileSynapse` class also overrides the `deserialize` method, returning the
    instance itself when this method is invoked. Additionally, it provides a `Config`
    inner class that enforces the validation of assignments (`validate_assignment = True`).
